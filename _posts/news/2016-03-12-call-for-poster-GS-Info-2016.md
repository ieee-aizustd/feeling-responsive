We invite the submission of proposals for poster presentations at Graduate School Information Fair (Wednesday, June 1, 2016 at the University of Aizu). 

Poster presentations will be an integral part of the at Graduate School Information Fair, with a session for interactive discussion between presenters (GS students) and attendees. *This aims at providing a valuable opportunity for exchanging research ideas/progress among GS students, and attracting UG students to join GS*.

Poster submissions may describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications, in all areas related to current reseach topics in the University of Aizu Graduate School.  Because posters are not formal publications, work submitted as a poster is eligible for future publication in other venues.

Poster submissions must be in English or Japanese. The submission must include an abstract (maximum one-page), plus a draft of the final poster. Please be aware that the poster draft is mandatory. Please prepare your poster in either portrait or landscape format. All submitted materials must be in PDF format with embedded fonts. Samples of poster abstracts and posters can be found in following links:
